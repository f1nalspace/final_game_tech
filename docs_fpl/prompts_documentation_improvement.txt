Please improve the documentation of the following C99 API functions, that is defined as a doxygen group, using the following rules:
- Prefer single line brief and use @note for clarification when a function name is not self-explainable
- Add [in] or [out] or [in, out] to every @param
- Include the actual type in every @param, custom types should be referenced with @ref at the very end
- Pointer should be called "Reference" instead
- @return should include the resulting type as well, but remove @return when the result is a void
- Every line should return with a period
- Leave the last @see @ref untouched, because those are special
- Please correct any spelling errors
- Fields in structs are documented with //! before the field, not to the right
- Values in enums are documented with //! before the value, not to the right
- Typedef should use @struct / @union / @enum etc. and @brief for the description as single line, the document style is /*! with * at the start and */ at the end
- No space identiation, for * line prefix
- The description of structs or unions are like this: Stores ... or Represents ...
- Enums should use the same style as structs, except that it uses @enum and has a description like this: An enumeration of ...
- Function typedef are like any other functions, but the description should start with: A function definition ...
- The description of functions that returns bool should always start with: Gets a value indicating wether ...
- Use at least @define and a @brief for every preprocessor define, if there are arguments and results, use the same style from functions

Please improve the documentation for the following C99 preprocessor defines with the following rules:
- Prefer single line brief and use @note for clarification when a function name is not self-explainable
- Add [in] or [out] or [in, out] to every @param
- Pointer should be called "Reference" instead
- Every line should return with a period
- Please correct any spelling errors
- No space identiation, for * line prefix
- Use at least @define and a @brief for every preprocessor define, if there are arguments and results, use the same style from functions
- Do not touch any defines starting with FPL__M, because this is internal
